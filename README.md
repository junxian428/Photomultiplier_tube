TUTORIAL

Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are the most sensitive light detectors you can get.

They are also just about the only vacuum tubes which are not obsolete.

One application for photomultiplier tubes is in conjunction with a scintillation crystal, which emits photons when hit by ionizing radiation, producing a very sensitive radiation detector. And one application of this, is a gamma camera.

Gamma cameras take an image (usually of a patient pumped with radioactive material) by combining scintillation plates with arrays of hundreds of photomultiplier tubes. The important point is that, like all medical equipment, it needs upgrading, and if one knows the right people, one can get one's grubby hands into a box of over two hundred PMTs!

Here is an individual tube.

The label reads: IGEMS part 46-300404P2

The manufacturer is GE, and I gather these were made round about the year 2000, but there's almost no information available about this particular tube on the net. No datasheets, no pinout, nada.

The front is 6cm across, the length is about 17.5cm.


Obligatory 'How PMTs Work' Section
The textbook picture of a PMT involves a Cathode, Anode and lots of Dynodes in-between. It starts with the photoelectric effect, light causing an electron to jump out of a material, and then high voltages electrostatically accelerate the electrons into the dynodes, each time gaining energy and with each collision knocking free more electrons. The cascade ends with the anode collecting the charge and turning it into a signal.

That's the theory anyway. In practice it's a little more convoluted - special photocathodes to maximize emission from certain wavelengths, and bizarre dynode geometry for the best balance between linearity, dark current, temperature stability and so on.

An excellent PDF file is available from Hamamatsu, a manufacturer of PMTs, here. It serves as both a manual and reference for actual designs of PMTs beyond the usual simplified diagrams.



Teardown
Since we have several tubes to spare, it is mandatory that we tear at least one of them to bits. To bits!
First step is removing the plastic tube at the base. This comes off by breaking or levering back the tabs around the rim.
